CVE Enumerator is a tool designed to extract, organize, and view Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) data from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) provided by NIST. This tool fetches CVE data within the last week and presents it in a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy navigation and analysis.


## Installation

    # Clone the repository:

    bash

    git clone https://github.com/lewallen4/CVE-Enumerator.git

    # Navigate to the project directory:

    bash

    cd CVE-Enumerator

    # Run the run.sh script:

    bash run.sh

## Usage

After running the run.sh script, the tool performs the following actions:

  - Generates a URL based on the ISO-8601 format for the past week.
    
  - Pulls CVE data from the NVD API within the specified time range and saves it to a JSON file (CVElist.json).
    
  - Sorts the CVE data by ID and splits it into separate JSON files, each representing an individual CVE entry.
    
  - Launches a GUI application (GUIv4.py) to view the CVE entries.

## Requirements

  - Python 3.x

  - requests library (install via pip install requests)
    
  - tkinter library (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
